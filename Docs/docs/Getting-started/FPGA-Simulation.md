# FPGA Simulation

TODO write the following in a user guide style:

- Setting up python environment
- Installing iverilog and GTKWave
- Quick test using existing code
- Running unit tests
- Creating your own (assembly) code
- ROM and RAM initialization
- Creating your own C code
- GPU output

!!! Note
    Just had an interesting thought where you could keep the simulation going forever and write a simple program that keeps displaying the latests ppm file (gpu output frame) to get a very slow but working system just from simulating. The big limitation is lack of input, but could be useful for testing a lot of programs
