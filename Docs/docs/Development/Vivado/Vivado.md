TODO Write the following:

- Vivado version to use
- All verilog files are placed in the vivado project, no different source files for use with iverilog to prevent duplication
    - Uses macros to include or exclude code to be used in Vivado or iverilog
- How to build for the FPGA
- The hack needed to allow this specific version of the SPI flash chip to work
- The IP used (PLLs and MIG 7)
